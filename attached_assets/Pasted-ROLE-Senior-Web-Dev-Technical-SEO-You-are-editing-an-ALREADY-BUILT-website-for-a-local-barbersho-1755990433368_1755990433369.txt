TOPLINE GOAL
Increase bookings/calls/directions and rank for local intent (“fade haircut san antonio”, “kids haircut san antonio”, “beard trim san antonio”) while passing Core Web Vitals.

A) CONVERSION IMPROVEMENTS (NO LAYOUT REBUILD)
1) Add a sticky mobile bottom bar (only on <992px): Book • Call • Directions.
   - Book → [PASTE_BOOKING_URL]
   - Call → tel:+12107172360
   - Directions → https://maps.google.com/?q=Lord’s+Barbershop+3751+Pleasanton+Rd+San+Antonio+TX+78221
   - Provide HTML/CSS/JS and ensure safe-area insets; hide on desktop.
2) Duplicate primary CTA row (“Book Online”, “Call Now”) after each major section: Hero, Services, Gallery, Team, Testimonials, Contact.
3) Add a short “Why Us” strip above testimonials: “Same-day fades • Open 7 days • Kid-friendly • Walk-ins when available”.

B) TECHNICAL SEO
1) Titles/Descriptions:
   - Home <title>: “Best Haircuts & Beard Care in San Antonio | Lord’s Barbershop” (≤60 chars)
   - Meta description (~155 chars): “Same-day fades, beard trims & classic shaves. Open 7 days. Book online or call (210) 717-2360. 3751 Pleasanton Rd, San Antonio.”
   - Ensure 1 H1 only on home; services as H2s.
2) Canonical on all pages; enforce HTTPS and single host (choose www or non-www) via 301s; consistent trailing slashes.
3) Create/verify sitemap.xml and robots.txt (link sitemap).

C) LOCAL SEO (Schema + NAP)
1) Footer NAP exactly as above, matching Google Business Profile format.
2) Inject JSON-LD Barbershop schema (update domain/og image when known):
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
 "@context":"https://schema.org",
 "@type":"Barbershop",
 "name":"Lord’s Barbershop",
 "url":"https://YOUR_DOMAIN/",
 "image":"https://YOUR_DOMAIN/img/og.jpg",
 "telephone":"+1-210-717-2360",
 "address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"3751 Pleasanton Rd","addressLocality":"San Antonio","addressRegion":"TX","postalCode":"78221","addressCountry":"US"},
 "openingHoursSpecification":[
  {"@type":"OpeningHoursSpecification","dayOfWeek":["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"],"opens":"09:00","closes":"20:00"},
  {"@type":"OpeningHoursSpecification","dayOfWeek":["Sunday"],"opens":"09:00","closes":"15:00"}],
 "sameAs":["[PASTE_FACEBOOK_URL]","[PASTE_INSTAGRAM_URL]"]
}
</script>
3) Add FAQ section on home (walk-ins, kids, parking, payments, average time, reschedule) and include FAQPage schema:
<script type="application/ld+json">
{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[
 {"@type":"Question","name":"Do you take walk-ins?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, when slots are open. Booking online guarantees your time."}},
 {"@type":"Question","name":"Are kids’ haircuts available?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes—kid-friendly barbers. Earlier hours are usually quieter."}},
 {"@type":"Question","name":"Where can I park?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Free parking is available on-site near the entrance."}},
 {"@type":"Question","name":"What payments do you accept?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Cash and major cards. Tips welcome in cash or card."}}
]}
</script>
4) DO NOT add AggregateRating unless first-party compliant.

D) LANDING PAGES (keep current design; add these pages + nav links)
Create and publish 4 SEO pages (600–900 words each, unique meta, 3 FAQs with schema, 1–2 gallery images linked to service):
- /mens-haircut-san-antonio/
- /fade-haircut-san-antonio/
- /beard-trim-san-antonio/
- /kids-haircut-san-antonio/
Each page must have: H1 “{Service} in San Antonio”, benefits, what to expect, time & price range, aftercare tips, internal links, top/bottom Book/Call CTAs.

E) PERFORMANCE (CORE WEB VITALS)
1) Hero image:
   - Convert to AVIF/WebP (≤250KB), add:
   <link rel="preload" as="image" href="/img/hero.avif" imagesrcset="/img/hero.avif 1x, /img/hero@2x.avif 2x" fetchpriority="high">
2) All images: supply width/height or CSS aspect-ratio to prevent CLS; add responsive srcset/sizes; `loading="lazy"` below the fold.
3) Inline critical CSS (~7–12KB) and defer the rest; `font-display: swap`; preconnect to fonts/CDN.
4) Defer non-critical JS; remove unused libraries; split bundles. Target: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.05, INP < 200 ms.

F) GALLERY → CONVERSION
- Keep current photos but add service chips (Fade, Taper, Kids). Each image links to the relevant landing page.
- If possible, add 1–2 before/after sliders. Ensure alt text is descriptive (“Mid-skin fade with beard lineup”).

G) TRUST, PRICING & POLICIES
- Add a concise “Pricing from $X” table and show no-show/late policy next to booking CTA.
- Keep testimonials as short text quotes with names—no stars or numeric ratings.

H) ACCESSIBILITY (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Contrast ≥4.5:1; visible :focus styles; “Skip to content” link.
- All interactive icons get aria-labels; forms use proper <label> with `for`.
- Forms: input type=tel for phone; add `autocomplete="name tel email"`.
- Announce validation errors inline and confirm success with a polite message.

I) ANALYTICS & EVENTS
- Ensure GA4 installed (and Meta Pixel if available).
- Track: book_click, call_click, directions_click, form_submit. Include eventLabel = {page}:{placement}. Verify in GA4 Realtime.

J) OPEN GRAPH / SOCIAL
- Add OG/Twitter tags sitewide with a clean 1200×630 image and proper title/description.

K) DELIVERABLES / ACCEPTANCE
- Provide code changes (HTML/CSS/JS/JSON-LD) and where inserted.
- Generate the 4 service pages with unique meta + FAQ schema.
- Publish sitemap + robots; fix canonical and redirects.
- Ship sticky mobile CTA bar and duplicate CTAs per section.
- Confirm Lighthouse: Mobile ≥90, Desktop ≥95 and CWV targets met.
- Provide a short README with how to update hours, prices, and gallery.

BEGIN NOW. Make only these improvements without altering the existing visual design.
